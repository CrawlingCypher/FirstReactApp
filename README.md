# FirstReactApp
This is my first app using React 

## What does it do
I have made a Task app that will let you see all the tasks you have as a list and be able to create new task and see them on the list.
Taking the basics of my HTML, CSS and javascript I wanted to be able to start learning a frontend framework.

## What I have learnt
With this project I was able to learn the fudementals of react and use of component for reusability. That is shown with the seperate tasks I have made. Each task is inside a bigger component called Tasks. 
I understand how to use destructuring to pass in props.
I have used a range of hooks such as useState useEffect.
